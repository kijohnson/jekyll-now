I graduated from the St. Louis Improv shop training center in 2017. My training is in longform improv, although I have occasionally dabbled in shortform. I currently play on a team called "Rockwell 4" on Thursday nights about once a month. What I love about Improv is all the life lessons it teaches you including listening, being on the same page, being present, and the power of agreeing. I use these lessons (or at least try to) in both my personal and professional lives.
