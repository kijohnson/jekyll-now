title: Day 3 Blog post-I fixed my problem!
---

I fixed my problem with the landing page on my github.io site being my blog posts. I created a blogs.md file containing all of the html code that directs the page that is created to the posts folder and then changed the link to the blogs.md file in my default.html file. Then I was left with an empty home page that is created in the index.html file. Not knowing html code, I copied some for the home page, modified it and put it in the index.html file. It isn't great but it does fix the problem. Learning how to do this is like peeling back the layers of an onion, little by little I figure out how to fix things and make the website better. I wonder what it will look like in a year? OH and the other thing I learned today was how to make my CV display as a page without all of the headings and such when you just link to its location in my github repository. See my about.md file in my kijohnson. github.io repository for that nice little trick.
