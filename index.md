Welcome to my Github.io site! This site is a compilation of both professional and personal information about me. I am currently an Associate Professor at Washington University in St. Louis. My research focuses on pediatric and young adult cancer epidemiology. I teach epidemiology and a class called Advanced Data Analysis. On the personal side, I am married with two young adult children. I took up Improv in 2015 or to get over the fear of public speaking and it has become a very nice hobby for me. In my spare time, I love to read fiction and I try to keep physically fit through running. I also enjoy eating out and travelling some.
